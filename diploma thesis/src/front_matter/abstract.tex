The assumption that services should run continuously is no longer reasonable in science oriented environments, where dynamic working approaches lead to fluctuating service utilization.
Making services available on-demand would be better suited in those situations.
For on-demand provisioning of services in cloud environments, suitable provisioning engines have to be set up first.
This diploma thesis presents the design for a 2-tiered bootware component that deploys provisioning engines into remote environments that can then be used to provision services on-demand.
The bootware can be called by other components via a web service interface and supports multiple provisioning engines and cloud environment via plugins.
The integration of the bootware into the SimTech SWfMS with an Eclipse plugin is also described, the bootware however is designed to be generic and can be used together with other systems.
