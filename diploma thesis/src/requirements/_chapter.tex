\chapter{Requirements and Constraints}
\label{requirements}

In this chapter we present the requirements and constraints that shape the development of the bootware.
We begin with the requirements, which were explicitly given at the beginning of this diploma thesis.
Then, we describe additional constraints which we added to limit the scope of the work.
