\chapter{Summary and Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}

In this diploma thesis we presented a design for bootware system that is able to deploy various provisioning engines as well as a workflow middleware into remote environments, on-demand and fully automatic.
Starting from previous work, we compared possible architecture alternatives and selected a 2-tiered architecture.
We made this architecture extensible via plugins and integrated a web service interface.
