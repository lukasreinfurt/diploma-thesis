\chapter{Introduction}

Workflow technology and the service based computing paradigm were mostly used in a business context until now.
But slowly they are extended to be used in other fields, such as eScience, where business centric assumptions that where previously true aren't reasonable anymore.
One of these assumptions is that services should run continuously.
This made sense in large enterprise where those services are used often.
Science, on the other hand, often takes a more dynamic approach, where certain services, for example for simulation purposes, are only used at certain times.
In those cases, it would make more sense to dynamically provision service only when they are needed.
