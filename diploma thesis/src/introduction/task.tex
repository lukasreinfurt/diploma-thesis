\section{Task of this Diploma Thesis}

The task of this diploma thesis is to design a small, independent bootstrapping system that can deploy provisioning engines on-demand in cloud environments in an automatic fashion.
It should be able to provision various provisioning engines in different cloud environments.
The provisioning engines then handle the actual provisioning of required workflow systems and services.
A managing component that keeps track of provisioned environments is also part of this system.
Support for different cloud environments and provisioning engines should be achieved through means of software engineering.
A functioning prototype that supports Amazon\footnote{\url{http://aws.amazon.com/}} as cloud environment and OpenTOSCA\footnote{\url{http://www.iaas.uni-stuttgart.de/OpenTOSCA/indexE.php}} as provisioning engine should be implemented.
