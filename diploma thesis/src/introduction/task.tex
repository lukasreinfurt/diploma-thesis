\section{Task of this Diploma Thesis}

The task of this diploma thesis is to design a lightweight bootstrapping system that can kick off dynamic provisioning in cloud environments.
It should be able to provision various provisioning engines in all kinds of cloud environments.
The provisioning engines then handle the actual provisioning of required workflow systems and services.
A managing component that keeps track of provisioned environments is also part of this system.

Support for different cloud environments and provisioning engines should be achieved through means of software engineering.
A functioning prototype that supports Amazon as cloud environment and TOSCA as provisioning engine should be implemented.
