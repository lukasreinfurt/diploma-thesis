\chapter{Fundamentals}
\label{fundamentals}

This chapter starts with a short description of bootstrapping, followed by an introduction into provisioning.
Then, we provide a short overview of the cloud landscape, with focus on Amazon's cloud offerings, since these are used in this diploma thesis.
We also introduce service oriented architecture and explain workflows and workflow management systems.
We finish with an overview of the SimTech project\footnote{\url{http://www.iaas.uni-stuttgart.de/forschung/projects/simtech/}}, of which this diploma thesis is a part of.
