\label{fundamentals}

This chapter starts with a short overview of the SimTech project\footnote{\url{http://www.iaas.uni-stuttgart.de/forschung/projects/simtech/}}, of which this diploma thesis is a part of.
Next, bootstrapping is defined in the context of this diploma thesis, since it can have various different meanings.
Then, a short overview of the cloud landscape is presented, with focus on Amazons cloud offerings, since these are used in this diploma thesis.
Finally, we take a look at provisioning solutions, in particular TOSCA, which is also used later in this thesis.
