\section{On demand Provisioning}
\label{related:ondemand}

\citeauthor{provisioning:ondemand} identify requirements that need to be addressed to make the current approach for scientific workflows used by the SimTech SWfMS more suitable for scientific simulation work. These requirements are: Dynamic allocation as well as release of computing resources, on-demand provisioning and deprovisioning of workflow middleware and infrastructure, and dynamic deployment and undeployment of simulation services and their software stacks. To fulfill these requirements, they propose a new service binding strategy that supports dynamic service deployment, an approach for dynamic provisioning and deprovisioning of workflow middleware, an architecture that is capable of these dynamic deployment and provisioning operations, and, as part of this architecture, the bootware - the subject of this diploma thesis - that kicks of these dynamic processes~\autocite{provisioning:ondemand}.

The new service binding strategy is necessary, because existing static and dynamic binding strategies, as shown on the left and in the center of \autoref{image:service_binding_strategies}, rely on services that are always running, or, as in the case of dynamic binding with service deployment, only dynamically deploy the service, but not its middleware and infrastructure. The new service binding strategy, shown on the right of \autoref{image:service_binding_strategies}, called \textit{dynamic binding with software stack provisioning}, is similar to the already existing dynamic binding with service deployment strategy, but adds the dynamic provisioning of the middleware and infrastructure required by the service~\autocite{provisioning:ondemand}.

Their approach for dynamic provisioning and deprovisioning of workflow middleware is separated into six steps. The first step is to model and start the execution of a simulation workflow. In the second step, the middleware for executing the worklfow, e.g. the SWfMS, and its underlying infrastructure are provisioned. Now, the workflow can be deployed on this middleware, which is step three. In step four, an instance of this workflow is executed. During this execution, some external service might be required that are not yet available. These services are provisioned on-demand in step six and also deprovisioned, if no longer required. The final step is to deprovision the workflow model and the workflow execution middleware after the execution of the workflow instance is finished~\autocite{provisioning:ondemand}.

The architecture they present can be separated into a local part and a cloud part, as well as different phases. In the modeling phase, a scientist uses local modeling and monitoring tools in combination with cloud hosted user and service repositories and a service registry to create a workflow. These components are always running. When he deploys the workflow, the local bootware component kicks of the on demand provisioning process and therefore the second phase, called middlware runtime phase. In this phase, the bootloader deploys a provisioning engine in the cloud, which in turn deploys the workflow middleware. Once the middleware is up and running, the workflow can be executed. During the execution, the ESB receives service calls from the workflow engine. Services, that are not running at this time can then be provisioned by the provisioning engine. This takes place in the third phase, the service runtime phase~\autocite{provisioning:ondemand}.
