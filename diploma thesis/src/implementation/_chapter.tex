\chapter{Implementation}

In this chapter we present details on the implementation of the bootware component.
First we select specific frameworks and libraries that allow us to implement the architecture we developed in \autoref{design}.
Then we present detailed descriptions of the implementation of some parts of the bootware.

\section{Selecting Frameworks and Libraries}
\label{selecting}

Before we can begin with the actual implementation, we have to decide on which framework and libraries we will use to implement the requested functionality.
In this section we present the frameworks and libraries we chose and the reasoning behind it.
We begin with plugin frameworks, followed by web service and PubSub libraries.
