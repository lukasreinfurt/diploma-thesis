\autoref{lst:context:sample} shows an exemplary context in XML form.
As we can see in line 2-4, it defines the plugins that should be used during the bootstrapping process by using the name of the plugin \textit{.jar}.
The name also includes the plugin version, so it would be possible to have different versions of the same plugin and switch between them if necessary.
In line 5-10 we can see the login credentials for a specific cloud provider, in this case Amazon AWS.
