\chapter{Requirements, Constraints and Design}

In this chapter we will talk about the design of the bootware component and the requirements and constraints that shape it.
We begin with the requirements, which were explicitly given at the beginning of the thesis.
Next, we describe additional constraints which we added to limit the scope of the work.
Then, we explain the design that formed as a result of the limitations that we had.

\section{Design}

In this section we will develop the design of the bootware.
This design is held intentionally abstract.
Specific implementation details will be selected and described in \autoref{selecting}.
