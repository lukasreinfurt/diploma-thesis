\chapter{Design}
\label{design}

In this chapter we will develop the design of the bootware.
This design is held intentionally abstract.
Some specific implementation details will be described in \autoref{implementation}.
We will describe the component division, modeler integration, external and internal communication, extensibility, and other aspects of the bootware system.
We will also present a step by step description of the internal process during a bootstrapping operation, before presenting the final bootware architecture.
