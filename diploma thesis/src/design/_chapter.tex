\chapter{Design}
\label{design}

In this chapter we will develop the design of the bootware.
This design is held intentionally abstract.
Some specific implementation details will be described in \autoref{implementation}.
We will describe the component division, modeler integration, external and internal communication, extensibility, and other aspects of the bootware system.
We will also present a step by step description of the internal process during a bootstrapping operation, before presenting the final bootware architecture.
But before we explain these details, we present a rough overview of what we want to accomplish with the bootware and how we plan to do it.
\autoref{image:bootwaresteps} shows an overview over the steps involved in the bootstrapping process.

In the first step, a user creates a workflow in a modeler application.
Now, they want to execute the workflow, for which they need some workflow middleware (i.e. a WfMS), but at the moment, no workflow middleware is running.
So first, the bootware is started to help with setting up this middleware, as shown in step two.
The bootware can load various plugins that allow it to provision cloud resources and applications.
In step three, it uses those plugins to create some cloud resources and to deploy a provisioning engine in this environment.
In the fourth step, the bootware tells this provisioning engine to provision the workflow middleware that is needed to execute the workflow.
Then, it sets up the connection between the modeler and this middleware.
Now that the workflow middleware is running and connected, the workflow can be deployed and executed on this middleware, which is shown in step five.
During this workflow execution, various services might be called.
These services might also not be available at this time, so the workflow middleware has to call provisioning engines to provision those services.
These provisioning engines might also not exist, so the workflow middleware also calls the bootware to deploy the provisioning engines it needs to provision the services.
When the workflow execution is finished, all services, the workflow middleware, the provisioning engines, the underlying cloud resources, and the bootware are deprovisioned in the sixth and final step.

To summarize, the bootware has to be able to provision cloud resources, provisioning engines, and the workflow middleware by using various plugins.
It has to connect the local modeler to the workflow middleware and support the workflow middleware by deploying additional provisioning engines if needed.
It also has to remove all resources once the workflow execution is finished.
Now that we have a rough understanding of the bootware and the bootstrapping process, we can begin describing the various parts of its design in more detail.
