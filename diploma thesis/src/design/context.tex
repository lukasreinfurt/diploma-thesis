\section{Context}
\label{context}

During the bootstrapping process, the bootware has to know certain things to be able do its job.
This includes the type of a request (e.g. deploy, undeploy, etc.) and which plugins it should use to provision the infrastructure, connect to it, and deploy the payload.
This also includes login credentials for cloud providers, which are necessary to provision the infrastructure in the first place.
This information can be combined into one object which describes the whole context of the current bootstrapping process.
Hence we will call such an object the context from now on.
